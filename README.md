# Energy-Consumption
This project is part of my research dissertation at Aston university

It involves studying the energy consumption patterns of top 5 countries of Europe selected on the basis of GDP. The enery consumptions basket taken into consideration is from various fossil and non-fossil fuels.
The years studied are from 1965 to 2021 and data has been arranged from various private, government and international organisations like World Bank, IEA, OECD, BP etc.
The dissertation also studies relationship between fossil fuels and GHG emissions which can be used to study the impacts of energy transition.

Various machine learning algorithms are used and they are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and f1 score.
